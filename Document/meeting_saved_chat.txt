box graph for average and stdextreme p value, ellipsoid, rectangular1.Verify Ellipsoid Caseellipsoid (3 verify)---Nan vs Model; Nan vs FE; Model vs FE---> other shapes --->Train: p, verify: training set vs test set---> Show the effect of p value2. P model* p + Nan vs FE ---> similar. Plot: xlabel = K_fe; ylabel = K_nan. (Prior)* Plot: heapmap x ---> discrete point, use size of circle/color to show the error. Reason: there's not enough points. The interpolation may be misleading(Make a table of different shapes, list p values, k values)3. * p + k model vs FE ---> similar* Plots similar to 2Work allocationLu: * regression model verification ( K, P model)* check machine learning course, show the reason of error (whether data quantity is enough).* show the effect of p (K w.r.t. p)Yu:* plot K_nan vs K_fe* modify heapmap
